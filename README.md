### WACK JACK: A Game of Revenge

200 years ago, Jack climbed a beanstalk and stole a whole bunch of stuff from some unsuspecting giants. Now, generations later, the giants are back and ready for revenge. But instead of Jack, they find his great great grandchildren. Wack Jack is a 1 player game of strategy, as Jack, try to reach the designated safe spaces before the Giant's mouth sucks you up to "grind your bones". If you reach the safe space you've lived to steal another day!

### Use your keyboard arrow keys (L) & (R) to control Jack's escape while the Giant pulls him up towards his death! Don't take too long or he'll be eaten!

###WireFrames:

The planning started early: 

Utilizing wireframes I was able to figure out what the true MVP of the Wack Jack project would be at this level of coding knowledge.

    Tier 1 MVP :
    Move Jack; down, left and right.

    Tier 1 MVP :
    Move Jack: perpetually up;
    Player Control Jack: Right;

##Images of WireFrames attached via Issue.


###Technology Used:

    Codepen.io 
    https://codepen.io/sir_massey/pen/MbzRvb - 1st version - Jack keyframes
    https://codepen.io/sir_massey/pen/aBXNGQ - Final working Game
    Jacks perpetual movement: keyframes (CSS animation);
    Jacks player initiated movement: JS document.onkeydown;

### ISSUES AND SETBACKS:

My first few attempts at coding everything out was in codepen, on my attempt to transfer it to sublime to transer to github, my code didn't transfer my JS player initiated movements for jack.
I wasn't able to add the alert saying when the game is over either through jack surviving or through jack dying. 

### YOU PICK JACK:
